	<h2 id="sec-reasoning">Why I am Documenting my Trash</h2>
	<p>
	It might sound weird to some but recording trash can serve to be beneficial. By recording one week of my trash, it can give me valuable insight into what items were of crucial, temporary importance in my life. This is because a lot of us do not put a lot of effort or thinking into the trash we throw out. Furthermore, documenting my trash can also tell me a lot about what my week was like. It can allow myself to know what sort of events might have occurred based on the trash I threw out. I am sure people would be pleased to get a recap of their possible hectic week from their trash. Trash can even let people figure out other peoples’ personalities. As a result, it would be interesting to have people get a glimpse into my life. Viewers could learn about my interests, what my hobbies are, my favorite foods, etc. It is a unique way to indirectly express myself and it is a fantastic way for viewers to be able to learn about me. Recording and sharing trash can also tell a lot about society in general. The trash I throw out can help me understand what items might have been popular at the time. I could also gain insights into how my interests and desires have changed overtime and reminisce on memories I have made with the items I have discarded. This project can become an unbelievably valuable piece of autobiography, allowing my future self to peek into my past benefitting me in an exceptionally clever way.</p>

	<h2 id="sec-authors">Authors Take on Trash</h2>
	<p>
	Fortunately, contemporary artist Vik Muniz would seem to agree with a lot of my points on trash. He would agree that recording trash can help to tell what items were popular or of significant importance long ago. After an unfortunate incident involving a museum burning down, Muniz channeled his creativity and talked about how he created his “Museum of Ashes” being a series of pictures of artifacts and what “the objects looked like before they were destroyed.” By taking artifacts that now shared properties of trash, Muniz was able to document the “trash” to allow people to know what they looked like long ago. As Muniz notes, “some people will still be rummaging the garbage heaps of history, but they will be looking for meaning that can’t be recycled.” According to reporter <a href="https://planetdetroit.org/author/jbrooker/"target="_blank">Jena Brooker</a>, people like Halima Cassels and Hannah Tizedes are also engaging in this idea by using trash and transforming them into art that “seeks to raise awareness and inspire action regarding climate change, environmental degradation, and plastic pollution.” Like Muniz, people are transforming trash into art that can benefit society. This also perfectly complements Muniz’s idea of how trash will live on but in some other form. </p>
	<p>
	Now you might be wondering what Muniz means by this statement. UChicago professor Sarah Newmann brings up the fact that “there is not, nor has there ever been, an ‘away’ for things to go.” This applies directly to waste as according to Newmann, “of all the plastic waste ever created-billions of metric tons-about 9% has been recycled.” Newmann is discussing how trash we throw away will inevitably come right back to us but in a new form like a recycled bottle which you probably have with you right now. Unfortunately, trash can also come back to us but in messier ways. In chapter 2 of Thill’s text “Waste”, he recounts a memory of a plastic bag tangled in a tree branch that day after day refused to leave. Despite harsh weather like “howling winds and rain and, eventually, ice and snow, the bag clung to its perch” marking its presence in the world filled with trash.

	<p>
	Besides the points I mentioned earlier of how trash can benefit me; I am most looking forward to how my future self will react to my past trash. I want to look back on this project and be amazed at the things I used to use or food and general items in which I was really interested in. It would be cool to look back in a couple years and realize how much I loved to play with helicopters or some sentimental items I threw away that I probably forgot about. It is a wonderful way to recount old memories and experiences we might tend to forget as we grow up. An online site called “ART ED GURU” created by students and inspired by Stephanie Kilgast who creates sculptures from discarded objects highlights students’ work on their discarded objects. These sculptures made of trash are directly inspired by Stephanie’s trash she made using discarded waste to raise environmental awareness. Students had gotten a piece of their trash and added natural elements being coral, fungi, or floral. In the process of creating these sculptures, the students also looked back on Stephanie’s videos to see how she created her sculptures. After reading the page, it made me realize how this site that documents trash transformed into art is a phenomenal way for these students to look back on it in the future. This site documenting the students’ trash is a great piece of memorabilia that can allow their future selves to reminisce upon when they are older. Sites like this show how trash can be used in a positive way where it is not only helping the environment but also raising awareness to environmental issues.
