	<h2 id="sec-preface">Preface</h2>
	<p>
	By recording one week of my trash, it can give me valuable insight into what items are of crucial, temporary importance in my life. This is because we might not put a lot of effort or thinking into the trash we throw out. Furthermore, documenting my trash can also tell me a lot about what my week was like. It can allow myself to know what sort of events might have occurred based on the trash I threw out that I didn’t really think much about.</p>
	<p>
	People can tell a lot about other people based on their trash. It would be interesting to have people get a glimpse into my life. Viewers could possibly learn about my interests, what my hobbies are, my favorite foods, etc. It is a unique way to indirectly express myself and it is a great way for viewers to be able to learn about me.</p>
	<p>
	Recording and sharing trash can also tell a lot about society in general. The trash I throw out can help me understand what items might have been popular at the time. I could also gain insights into how my interests and desires have changed overtime and reminisce on memories <a href="goel-twp-theory.html">continue reading...</a></p>

	<h2 id="sec-overview">Overview</h2>
	<p>
	During my week of disposing trash, I encountered some patterns I found interesting. I noticed that 4 items I had planned to discard were old items I used throughout my childhood. They were items such as an old learning pc, controller, helicopter, and board game that I no longer used because they just sat in my drawer. Compared to previous weeks, this week included some items that were a huge part of my early childhood and that kept me entertained for a long time.</p>
	<p>
	Some difficulties I did face was the act of disposing some of my trash, specifically the sentimental items. I had a very strong urge to keep them as I felt a bit of sadness throwing away memorabilia that I made so many happy moments with. There was a point throughout the week where I thought maybe I could start using some items again or maybe try fixing broken items that laid in my drawer originally collecting dust. Throwing out items also allowed me to recall the amount of time I have held onto them for, making it that more difficult to leave them.</p>
		
	<h3>Worn-Out and Used</h3>	
	<p>The first group of items share the common property of being worn out and used. This group of items are the <a href="https://www.jnj.com/our-heritage/18-facts-about-the-history-of-band-aid-brand-adhesive-bandages#:~:text=Earle%20Dickson%2C%20a%20cotton%20buyer,a%20new%20product%20was%20born."target="_blank" class="highlight">band-aid</a> wrapper, <a href="https://seekbamboo.com/blogs/sustainable-lifestyle/charcoal-toothbrush-benefits#:~:text=The%20story%20of%20charcoal%20in,toxins%20and%20stains%20from%20teeth."target="_blank" class="highlight">charcoal toothbrush</a>, <a href="https://www.lynchburgmuseum.org/blog/2015/12/1/a-tinkering-pharmacist-an-artist-and-the-worlds-smartest-investment#:~:text=Occupying%20purses%20and%20pockets%20around,that%20time%2C%20ChapStick%20was%20his!"target="_blank" class="highlight">ChapStick</a>, and <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/history-of-kleenex-tissue-1992033#:~:text=In%201928%2C%20the%20familiar%20pop,packs%20of%20Kleenex%20were%20introduced."target="_blank" class="highlight">tissue box</a>. Starting with the band-aid wrapper, it is a small wrapper with red and blue text on it, I got it several months ago for college just in case I got hurt, and my experience with it wasn’t too memorable as I quickly discarded it when I put the band-aid on my cut. The next item is an empty Chapstick which I had gotten a year ago. It is a small bottle I got as I suffer from very dry skin and one memorable moment I had was when I accidently applied it on my arm thinking it was lotion. To continue, I also threw away a month old, charcoal toothbrush I got several months back as I usually replace them when I have used them for slightly more than a month. Lastly, I threw out an empty purplish tissue box that I got a couple weeks ago so I could control my nose during the winter season and one memorable experience I had was when I used it as a napkin to clean my hands.</p>
	
	<h3>Toys and Entertainment</h3>
	<p>My second group of items fall under the category of toys and entertainment consisting of a <a href="https://www.theforgottentoyshop.co.uk/blogs/news/15235037-the-history-of-snakes-ladders#:~:text=It%20was%20first%20found%20and,involves%20two%20or%20more%20players."target="_blank" class="highlight">board game</a>, <a href="https://wrcs.org.au/WP1/a-history-of-rc-technology/#:~:text=The%20first%20general%20use%20of,mechanical%20actuation%20in%20the%20model."target="_blank" class="highlight">RC controller</a>, and <a href="https://www.streetdirectory.com/travel_guide/106074/model_toys/history_of_radio_controlled_model_helicopters.html"target="_blank" class="highlight">RC helicopter</a>. Starting with the board game, it is a Happy Feet Two themed slopes and ladders board game that I had received as a gift two years ago. This was one board game I used to play with my sisters whenever I had free time with them. I am throwing it out as throughout the years I transitioned into PC video games. The next item is an RC controller. It is a white Air Hogs controller that was made to control a small drone which I received ten years ago so I had something fun to play with. A memorable experience I had with this controller was when a row of LED lights lit up on the controller amazing the 9-year-old version of me, and I am throwing it away as unfortunately, the small drone broke a while back. Lastly, this category has a small, blue RC helicopter. Like the small drone, I got it several years ago so I could fly it around. I ended up throwing it away because the battery inside the helicopter completely died.</p>
	
	<h3>Learning and Writing Tools</h3>
	<p>My last group represents learning and writing tools such as a <a href="https://toys.fandom.com/wiki/Nitro_Jr._Notebook#MANUFACTURING" target="_blank" class="highlight">learning computer</a> and a <a href="https://www.historyofpencils.com/writing-instruments-history/history-of-mechanical-pencils/"target="_blank" class="highlight">mechanical lead tube</a>. Starting with the mechanical lead tube, I got it during winter break as it came in the packaging of a lead pencil. The tube is small and transparent with a white cap. Unfortunately, the tube ran out of lead so there was no point in holding onto it any longer. One moment I remember was when I tried to get some lead out of the bottle and a whole bunch of lead fell out of the tube onto the floor. As a child my parents had gotten me a Vtech, educational learning computer when I was in elementary school. My parents got it for me so I could improve in my classes. The learning computer has a green lid, silver frame, and greenish keys. I am now throwing it out as I realized it is no longer functional and does not serve much of a purpose, given I have a general-purpose laptop.</p>

	<h2 id="sec-profile">Profile: Item of the Week</h2>
	<img src="TWP Pictures\learning computer actionshot.jpg" alt="Learning PC Actionshot">
	<p>
	The item I chose to be the item of the week is my childhood learning laptop. I selected this laptop since I’ve created so many memories with it and it was the one item I really enjoyed using when I was a kid. I first received this laptop from my parents when I was around the age of six. I vividly remember sitting on the couch, pressing the smooth power button, and hearing the nostalgic start up sound. Even if I didn’t turn it on, I loved staring at the beautiful green lid and pressing the snappy green keys. There were times I would just press the keys and pretend I’m typing something on the screen. There were also some sad memories I had with this laptop. One such memory was when I lost game cartridges that would plug into the laptop. Eventually, when I became a teenager, I stopped using the laptop and it just sat in my drawer collecting dust until eventually I noticed it and realized it’s time for it to go.
	</p>
	<p>
	Nitro Jr. Notebooks made by Vtech were manufactured back in 2006. However, the laptop wasn’t released until 2008. The computer came with eight cartridges ranging from math all the way to art. There were three versions of this computer released in France, Germany, and the UK. In France, the laptop was branded as Genius XL Explorer. In Germany it was Genius Lern laptop and in the UK, it was called Activ-8 notebook. The laptop came with a keyboard, LCD screen, volume switch, mouse, and a reset button.

	Documenting my first week of trash was a very rewarding and nostalgic experience. I want to thank everyone who came to view my weekly trash, and I hope you got to learn something about me. I am really looking forward to next week to see what else I end up discarding. Have a nice day!
