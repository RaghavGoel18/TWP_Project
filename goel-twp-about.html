	<p><a href="https://github.com/RaghavGoel18"target="_blank" class="highlight">Raghav Goel</a> is currently a second year student who is dorming at Rutgers New-Brunswick and is passionate about technology as well as its capabilities. He is planning on majoring in computer science and has a vast array of knowledge in computer hardware. A couple months ago, he received a certificate in the fundamentals of AI, allowing him to be prepared for technology in the 21st century. Last summer, Raghav worked as an in-store shopper which helped him gain valuable experience in the job field as well experience in communication with customers but also co-workers. In his leisure time, Raghav enjoys outdoor hobbies such as going to the park, flying his RC helicopter and drone, and riding on his electric scooter. After college he hopes to pursue a job as a developer in the computer science field, live on his own, and make tremendous contributions to his future job and the tech industry. </p>
